To reproduce the experiments from the LICS submission, please do the following.  Unless otherwise specified, each command is to be run in the context of the experiments directory.

Setup
======

You will need to be running in a unix environment equipped with the prerequisites for building LOIS and NLambda.

Ensure that all the tools/libraries are built correctly:
* To build all of the experiments related to DEQ, run "stack build" from the root of the repository.
* To build LOIS, run "unzip lois/lois.zip -d lois" to unpack the source code for the exact version of LOIS to the lois directory. Change to this directory and run "make".
* To build the harness for LOIS, change to the directory lois/stacks and run "g++ -std=c++0x -O3 stacks.cpp ../bin/liblois.a -o stacks"
* To build NLambda, from the directory nlambda, run "stack build".
* To build deq, from the root of the repository run "stack build".
* Edit the file Makefile to set the bin directory containing the nlambda and deq executables that were built in the previous two steps.

Benchmarking
=============
In all output files, the final column records the time taken in ms.

Deq:
* To produce the results from Figure 1(a), please run "make scale" and "make glbl".  The results are output to the files "scale.txt" and "global.txt" respectively.
* To produce the results from Figure 1(b), please run "make deq-allpairs".  The results are output to the file "deq-allpairs.txt". 
* To produce the results from Figure 1(c), please run "make onestate". The results are output to the file "one.txt".

NLambda:
* To produce the results from Figure 1(b), please run "make nlambda-allpairs". The results are output to the file "nlambda-allpairs.txt".

LOIS:
* To produce the results from Figure 1(b), please run "make lois-allpairs". The results are output to the file "lois-allpairs.txt".
