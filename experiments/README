To run the experiments, please follow the instructions below.  Unless otherwise specified, each command is to be run in the context of the experiments directory.

Setup
======

In order to run the experiments, it is convenient to be running in a unix environment equipped with make.

Ensure that all the tools/libraries are built correctly:
* To build all of the experiments related to DEQ, run "stack build" from the root of the repository.
* Edit the file Makefile to set the bin directory containing the deq executable that was built in the previous step.

Benchmarking
=============
In all output files, the final column records the time taken in ms.

* To produce the results of the automata-simulating-a-finite-stack experiments, please run "make scale", the results are output to the file scale.txt.  The source for this experiment is in the subdirectory ../Stacks
* To produce the results of the local/global freshness experiment, run "make glbl".  The results are output to the file "global.txt".  The source for this experiment is in the subdirectory ../global
* To produce the results of the one-state experiment, please run "make onestate". The results are output to the file "one.txt".  The source for this experiment is in the subdirectory ../one
